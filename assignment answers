Questions: Introduction to GitHub:

What is GitHub, and what are its primary functions and features? Explain how it supports collaborative software development. Repositories on GitHub:

Github is a web-based platform used fior version control and collaborative software development. it uses git ,an open source vervison control system to track change s in source codes during developmements.
it's primary functions are :1-version control through git intergration and commit history ,2:collaboration through pull requests ,code reviews and issues and labels, another function is project management and code hosting and sharing
it supports collaborative software development through branching and merging,pill requests and code reviews,distributed work flows,communicatin and documentation,integration with tools and finallyu access control

What is a GitHub repository? Describe how to create a new repository and the essential elements that should be included in it. Version Control with Git:

A Github repository is a storage location where all the files ,code and resources for a project aree stored and managed.
How to create a repo you juct click the plus icon(+) and you put a name for it  and define it's vibility

What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.

Branches in GitHub are separate lines of development within a repository. They allow developers to work on different features, fixes, or experiments independently from the main codebase. Each branch represents an isolated environment where changes can be made without affecting the main project until those changes are ready to be merged.
the importance of branches are isolation,parallel development ,code review and testing and rollback

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.

A pull request in Github is  a method for submitting contributions to a project. it enables developers to notify others about changes they've pushed to a repository and propose that those changes be merged into the main codebase.
